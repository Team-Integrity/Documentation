# Lane-Keeping and Obstacle-Avoidance System

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the Autopilot system, specifically focusing on the lane-keeping and obstacle-avoidance capabilities. Our aim is to improve the performance of the Autopilot system, making it more robust and precise in navigating through lanes and avoiding obstacles.

## Installation Guide

To install the Lane-Keeping and Obstacle-Avoidance System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
`git clone https://github.com/Carson-We/Machine-Learning.git`

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Set up the required hardware components and configure the environment as specified in the project documentation.

## Usage Instructions

To use the enhanced Autopilot system, follow these instructions:

1. Import the Autopilot module into your project:
   from autopilot import Autopilot

2. Initialize the Autopilot object:
   autopilot = Autopilot()
  
3. Connect the vehicle's sensors and controllers to the Autopilot system.

4. Call the Autopilot's control function to activate the automated navigation:
   autopilot.control() This function will continuously monitor sensor inputs, process the data, and generate control commands for maintaining lane position and avoiding obstacles.

5. Monitor the vehicle's behavior and performance while the Autopilot is engaged. Ensure that the algorithm operates reliably and accurately.

## Demo

We have included a comprehensive demo in the `demo/` directory to showcase the enhanced capabilities of the Autopilot system. To run the demo, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `demo/` directory:
   cd demo

2. Execute the demo script:
   python autopilot_demo.py
   The demo script will simulate real-world scenarios, demonstrating the improved reliability and accuracy of the Autopilot system in lane-keeping and obstacle-avoidance tasks.
